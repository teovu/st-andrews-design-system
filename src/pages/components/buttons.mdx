# Buttons

Buttons are used to help a user carry out an action, such as starting an application process, or changing the current page, such as submitting a form.
<div class="component-preview">
    <MainButton primary>Button</MainButton>
</div>

## Rules for buttons
  1. Buttons must be used only within main body of a page; they must not be used in asides.
  2. Buttons must not be used mid-sentence. They must always appear on their own line separated from written content.
  3. Buttons linking to downloadable content must use the icon button option.

```js
  <MainButton primary>Primary</MainButton>
```

## Primary button

We use the primary button for main actions like saving a form or creating a new item.

<div class="component-preview">
    <MainButton primary>Primary button</MainButton>
</div>

```js
<MainButton primary>Primary button</MainButton>
```
